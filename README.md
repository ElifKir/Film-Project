Film Project with JS

I made this app while learning javascript. 
I used HTML, JS.
This application is a movie application that works with user input.

How to use ?

The first box is the name of the movie, and the next box is the director of the movie.

Finally, in order to add an image, if the address of a photo related to that movie is copied from the search engine and copied to the box with the "film afiş linki", the user will have added a movie to the application.

When added in this way, the message "movie added successfully (film başarıyla eklendi.)" will be displayed on the screen.

Then, when we want to delete the movie, we can delete it from the "delete movie (filmi sil)" option in the red box. 

If we want to delete all movies, we can delete all movies from the "delete all movies (tüm filmleri sil.)" button.

Note : When using the application, you should copy the address of the photo and add it to the application, not a direct copy of the photo in the search engine.
